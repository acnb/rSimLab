# rSimLab

A package for the simulation of measurements in laboratory medicine. Complex settings can be created from simple building blocks.

Example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# General settings (here: samples per day)
setting <- simpleOverTime(365,500, 50)
# Analytes with distribution of true values.
ana <- analyte(setting) %>%
    ana_distrNorm(3.5 , .886)
# Measurements with imprecision and bias.
mm <- measurement(ana) %>%
    mm_precCharFunc(.067, 0.031) %>%
    mm_truenessFunc(0, .03)
# Execute simulation.
runSim(mm)
```
Please refer to the inline documentation for further examples.
